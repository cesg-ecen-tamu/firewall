Overview
--------
This is the repository for the firewall data-plane architectures and 
simulations. Currently, there is only base code for generic simulation.

I have started the project with the GPL license as a default, we can change it 
later as necessary. -jc

Build Notes
-----------
1. You will need the g++-4.6 compiler to work with this project.
2. Once you have this compiler installed and running correctly either create a 
   symbolic link or an alias for the binary name of this compiler to g++46 so
   that the unmodified Makefile will work with your environment. The following
   is a quick example of the two options ...

   a) In your .bash_profile add ... alias g++46="/..path../your_binary_name"
   b) sudo ln -s /..path../your_binary_name /usr/bin/g++46 
3. Once you have your environment established simply type make to build the 
   project.
4. You may build documentation by typing make docs; however, this requires you 
   have doxygen installed on your system.
5. I've included a version of my .vimrc file that you may incorporate if you use
   vim.

Style Guidelines
----------------
1. This will be a minimal list, if in doubt please try and follow the existing 
   style of the code.
2. Do not use more than 80 columns in your code.
3. Open braces, {, should not be on their own line.
4. Your tab stops should be set to 3 spaces.
