Overview
--------
This is the repository for the firewall data-plane architectures and simulations. 
Currently, there is only base code for generic simulation.

Build Notes
-----------
1. You will need the g++-4.6 compiler to work with this project.
2. Once you have this compiler installed and running correctly either create a 
   symbolic link or an alias for the binary name of this compiler to g++46 so
   that the unmodified Makefile will work with your environment. The following
   is a quick example of the two options ...

   a) In your .bash_profile add ... alias g++46="/..path../your_binary_name"
   b) sudo ln -s /..path../your_binary_name /usr/bin/g++46
